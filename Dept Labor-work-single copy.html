                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p></p>
            <p class="mb-5">A large portion of the American population is being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It has forced many companies and schools to completely shut down or go online. Millions of Americans are being forced into unemployment and parents are having to juggle work while their children attend school from home. </p>
            <p>The former Department of Labor website offered poor content organization, little to no implemention of a UI style guide, and confusing jargon. In this unfortunate time of the COVID-19 pandemic, many employers especially families are having to decide between caring for their loved ones and risking their economic security.     </p>

                <h5>The Problem</h5>
                <p>The US Department of Labor Website is confusing and difficult to navigate for users.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <h5>The Solution</h5>
                <p>To redesign the information architecture of the navigation to improve the usability of the Department of Labor website.</p>

              <h1>Research</h1>
             <p>In order to gain more knowledge behind a gamers shopping experience we interviewed subject matter experts, deployed surveys, and conducted a competitive analysis on a few competitors.</p>
             <p>Our research objectives were pretty straight forward we wanted to understand how users search and choose their gaming products and accessories. And, also understand needs and their pain points during their shopping process.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- research findings -->
      

      <div class="col-md-8">
        <strong>A few of the KPIs we wanted to focus on during testing were...</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Task success rate (select product and checkout).</li>
          <li>Search vs. Navigation</li>
          <li>Time-on-Task</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We interviewed 3 users who were all heavily involved in gaming and we determined that our users care most about having a simple shopping and checkout process that also allows them to compare specs and pricing. So after testing, interviewing, and surveying, we used our findings to create an affinity diagram and an empathy map in order to define who our users is. </p>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
          <p>As expressed by users, the current dell website is confusing to navigate. We began the process of card sorting to better understand how to structure the website in a user friendly way. We used a card sorting technique where we reorganized the information and original navigation on the main Dell site into categories that made the most sense for the gaming microsite.  </p>
          <p class="text-center mb-8"><img src="images/Project 3-Dell - Affinity Diagram 1.0.jpg" alt="Image placeholder" class="img-fluid"></p>
          <p>Based on the card sorting insights, we created a new site map that is simpler, focused more on gaming, and included added feature prioritization matrix like the "compare" and "build your own gaming system" options. WE wanted the microsite to feel cost efficent with easy maintenance.   </p>


          <h1>Card Sorting</h1>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h1>Wireframes</h1>
         <p>My next step involved looking through our site map, user flow, feature prioritization matrix to create sketches. Since I was working with many creative designers, it was relatively easy to move straight into digitial lo-fi prototypes. </p>
         <p>Based on our features and information architecture, we came up with a simple layout with the goal of easy navigation, highlighting gaming products, not over-crowding the product page with specs, and including a quick checkout process. We worked toward these goals by adding multiple tabs in the navbar, buttons to reduce the amount of text and better visuals.</p>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h1>Detailed Specs</h1>
         <p>Before making those iterations and creating a hi-fi prototype, we created a UI style guide. Our goal was to stay aligned with Dell's branding to ensure brand recognition within the microsite. This inolved researching the main style guide for Dell as a company as a launching point for microsite styling.   </p>
         <p>Our goal was to make the gaming microsite feel like other gaming-specific product websites so we researched competitors like EA, Playstation, Xbox, and Aleinware. We found out that their color palettes included bright colors and contrasted with black and grey.</p>
         <p>Taking what we learned from Dell's competitors, plus Dell's branding, we decided to make a color palette that included bright shades of blue, purple, and black. Lastly, we created new versions of the Dell logo, specifically for the gaming microsite.</p>

        <div class="col-md-10">
          <h1>The Execution</h1>
          <strong>The gallery belows shows our Hi-Fi desktop and mobile prototype. </strong>
         <p>In our hi-fidelity prototype, we resolved the user's pain points from the lo-fi testing, aiming to make experience more intuitive.</p>
         <ul>
           <li>We added recommended items in the "view product" pages.</li>
           <li>We added multiple paths back to the Home Page.</li>
           <li>We differentiated "products" and "shop" tabs by renaming them to "product brands" and "hardware".</li>
         </ul>

        <div class="col-md-10"> 
        <h1>Validation</h1>
          <strong>Testing Our Assumptions </strong>
         <p>Once the team had a hi-fidelity prototype ready for use, we knew we needed to put it in the hands of our users. In this iteration, we tested the same 4 flows as the previous one and found out that the only task with 100% success rate was creating an account.</p>
         <p>Interestingly, the themes we discovered during this phase were the same issues we discovered after launch:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>They had a hard time finding the "build your own pc system" tab and also found the naming of that feature confusing- they weren't sure if they were customizing a laptop or assembling a group of items.</li>
           <li>They found the design "boring and unoriginal".</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Unfortunately, there were some glitches with Figma that interfered with this testing round, like interactions not working even through they were prototyped correctly. We took that into consideration and had users tell us what they would do and how they would choose to navigate if the prototype was fully functioning.</p>
